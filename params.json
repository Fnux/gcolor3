{"name":"Gcolor3","tagline":"A simple color chooser written in GTK3","body":"Gcolor3 is a color selection dialog written in GTK+ 3. It is much alike [Gcolor2](http://gcolor2.sourceforge.net/), but uses the newer GTK+ version to better integrate into your modern desktop. It has the same feature set as Gcolor2, except that recent versions of Gcolor3 use an `.ini` \t    style file to save colors (older versions use the same file as Gcolor2).\r\n\r\nCompare Gcolor3 with Gcolor2:\r\n\r\n# Versions\r\nThe most recent version of Gcolor3 requires GTK+ 3.12. If your distribution uses an older version, please see [the older releases](https://github.com/Unia/gcolor3/releases). Functionally, all releases are the same; the only exception is that since version 2.0 Gcolor3 uses an `.ini` style format to save colors.\r\n\r\n# Translations\r\nYou can help translate Gcolor3 to your own language! Currently, Gcolor3 is available in British English, Dutch, French, German, Norwegian and Swedish. New translations are always welcome! For instructions on how to translate Gcolor3, see the project [README](https://github.com/Unia/gcolor3/blob/master/README.md).\r\n\r\n# Bugs\r\nFor any bug or feature request, please [create an issue](https://github.com/Unia/gcolor3/issues) on [GitHub](https://github.com/Unia/gcolor3).\r\n\r\n# Copyright\r\nGcolor3 is maintained by [Jente Hidskes](https://github.com/Unia).  \r\nCopyright Â© 2013-2015 [Jente Hidskes](mailto:hjdskes@gmail.com).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
